                    <h2>Purchase</h2>
                    <p>As soon as my husband and I arrived in Maryland, we knew that we wanted a place to get away from work and suburban city life on the weekends. We hadn't made a conscious effort to find that getaway, but an ad on Craigslist&reg; found us. Somewhere in West Virginia (yet another state unknown to us) was a little quaint cabin - in an RV park? - waiting for some TLC. We made an appointment with owner to see the little building, and we immediately fell in love. We had to hide our enthusiasm at first, though, because another couple was also viewing the cabin during the same appointment. We saw TONS of potential, but they had first dibs, so we waited for them to talk themselves out of it. They declined the opportunity to buy the cabin, and when they walked away, we handed the owner a downpayment to officially lay claim to the property. See in the photo below... what's not to love?!</p>

                    <h2>Clean Up</h2>
                    <p>Once we bought the place, we had to wait from the end of December until the end of March to wait for the park to open and provide utilities. But once we got into the park, we had a lot of clean up work to do. The previous owner left furniture, clothes, dishes, towels, trash, and even tools. We sorted through everything and started the daunting task of removing all the stuff we didn't want and cleaning anything we wanted to keep.</p>

                    <h2>Removal of the Ramp</h2>
                    <p>The next big project required that we remove a handicap-accessible ramp from the front step. It didn't allow rainwater to drain properly, so the wood of the ramp and the front step both were rotten. The builder had used nails, screws, AND glue to hold it together - it was a beast!</p>

                    <h2>Tree Removal</h2>
                    <p>After we made the front step safer, we moved on to removing an unhealthy pine tree from the front yard. The tree had several huge pine tar flows running down its sides that made an extremely sticky mess of anything that got close - or parked under it!</p>

                    <h2>New Roof</h2>
                    <p>With some of the worst trees out of the way, we realized that the roof of our little haven was desperately in need of replacement. We first hired a local guy to do the work, but he turned out to be unreliable. We learned a valuable lesson through this process: ask your neighbors for their recommendations and reviews of local workers! We had much better luck with a second crew that was recommended by a neighbor. In just about 4 hours, they stripped off the old roof, replaced several sections of the plywood, completely reshingled the entire roof, then cleaned up! And not a minute too soon... they'd been done about 15 minutes when the skies opened up for a good, drenching, West Virginia rain!</p>

                    <h2>Paved Driveway</h2>
                    <p>While getting new siding onto the building was our next priority, we had to wait a couple of weeks due to a scheduling conflict with the contractor. We didn't want to waste beautiful summer weather, so we moved ahead with the next project in line: paving a new driveway. My hadband and I ride Harleys, so the lack of paved parking - and the muddy slope of the yard - made it difficult to safely park our bikes at the cabin between rides. The asphalt made all the difference!</p>

                    <h2>New Siding</h2>
                    <p>Once we got the scheduling figured out with the contractor, the process of siding went pretty quickly. Two side of the cabin had had no siding to protect the bare plywood exterior walls, and two walls had siding that was painted and failing in several places. Our humble little getaway was the eyesore of the neighborhood! With new siding, the whole property looked a ton better!</p>

                    <h2>New Shed</h2>
                    <p>We were making progress in leaps and bounds! Our little rustic cabin now had a new roof, newsiding, new front steps, and even a new driveway. Now it was time to add something to the property that was really more <i>want</i> than <i> need </i>... a new shed/ workshop/ garage for the bikes!</p>

                    <p>We got a lot done in just a couple of summers, but there will always be more to do! We still need to reinforce some sections of flooring, update the bathroom and add a shower, and repaint interior walls. The list is much longer than these three projects, but there's no need to get too far ahead of ourselves. We realize that no matter how much we get done at the cabin, there will ALWAYS be more projects to keep us busy!</p>
